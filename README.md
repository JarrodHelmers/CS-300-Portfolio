# CS-300-Portfolio

## What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
For Project One, the objective was to analyze different data structures to determine which would be the most efficient in terms of runtime and memory usage for a specific application. In Project Two, the task was to implement a solution by utilizing the selected data structure to effectively manage and sort course data, thereby demonstrating the practical application of theoretical knowledge.

## How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
To create efficient and scalable software solutions, it is important to understand common data structures and how they impact performance and resource utilization. I started by reviewing data structures from a theoretical standpoint and then put my knowledge into practice by creating simple prototypes to measure their effectiveness. Choosing the appropriate data structure is crucial because it can significantly improve the performance of real-world applications.

## How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
Whenever I came across obstacles like problems with the performance of data structures or bugs in my code, I adopted a multi-faceted approach to resolve them. This included using debugging tools, seeking advice from others, and conducting research. Additionally, I found it helpful to participate in online community forums and review lecture materials as they offered valuable insights to overcome the challenges.

## How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
Through my experience working on various projects, I have come to realize the significance of upfront design decisions in shaping the later stages of development and maintenance. This has taught me the importance of considering different factors such as data volume, operational complexity, and future scalability while choosing how to structure and store data.

## How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
The project helped me to improve my coding and documentation skills by reinforcing best practices. As a result, I started writing cleaner and more organized code with detailed comments and documentation. This practice not only makes maintenance easy but also ensures that my code can be easily adapted and understood by others. I also learned how to emphasize modularity and use version control effectively, which were significant learning points for me.
